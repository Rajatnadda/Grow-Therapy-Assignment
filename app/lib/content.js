        "My work often focuses on anxiety, panic, trauma, and burnout. Clients frequently come to me feeling “functional” on the outside while quietly struggling with constant worry, tension in their body, difficulty sleeping, or a sense that they’re always bracing for something to go wrong. Others are navigating the impact of earlier life experiences that continue to affect their relationships, confidence, or sense of safety.",
        "Trauma work is an important part of my practice. I work with adults who have experienced single-incident trauma as well as more complex, long-standing patterns that may stem from childhood, relationships, or chronic stress. My approach is paced carefully, with an emphasis on safety, stabilization, and helping clients feel more regulated in their daily lives—not just during sessions."
